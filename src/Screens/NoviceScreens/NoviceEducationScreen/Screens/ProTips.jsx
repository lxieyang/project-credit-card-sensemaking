            building your credit history.

          <h4>Use Credit Responsibly</h4>
          <p>
            While credit cards can help build credit history, they can also be
            easy to misuse. Applying for too many credit cards, exceeding your
            credit limit and falling behind on payments can all negatively
            affect your credit score. In addition, closing old cards you no
            longer use can impact your credit history. Keeping your credit cards
            open will help build your credit history.

          <p>
            Paying your bills on time signals to creditors that youâ€™re
            responsible and establishes you as a good credit risk.

            Keeping an eye on your credit score is important. Identity theft,
            credit card fraud and other scams can all lead to inaccurate
            information on your credit report. You can get a free report once
